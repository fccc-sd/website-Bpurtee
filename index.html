                <h3>About Me</h3>

                <p>
                    I was born on <em>June 9th, 2006</em> and was raised in <em>Defiance Ohio</em>
                    and have lived there for my <strong>whole life</strong>. I recently change schools
                    from <em>Defiance High School</em> to <em>Four County Career Center</em> to get 
                    a job as a game designer. <br><br>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            
                <p>
                    I started liking golf when I was given lessons during the summer 
                    and have been <spam id="importantThingtoKnow">taking lesson during summer ever since</spam>, I also like to watch 
                    <em>Youtube</em> and look stuff up (like an animal I never seen before
                    or a important event I didn't know about) on my phone,
                    and I like building different kinds of <em>LEGO</em> sets.
                    I also like a computer game called <em>Friday Night Funkin</em>, if
                    you would like to try it, visit <a href="https://www.snokido.com/game/friday-night-funkin">
